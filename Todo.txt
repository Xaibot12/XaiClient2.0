[] Create a friend system. There should be a module in "settings" called "Friends". There should be a text input where the player can add usernames to add as friends and delete friends easily. Also in Friends, add a booleansetting "Middle-Click-Friends" that allows the user to add players to the friend list just by looking at them and pressing the middle mouse button.
[] Integrate the friend system into Nametags: When a nametag of a friend is rendered, it should add a green outline to the background of the nametag.
[] ESP: Split ESP into "PlayerESP" and "ESP". The old ESP should be for general mobs. The user can select what mobs hitboxes should glow and also the color for each mob. PlayerESP works only for Players. Here, the User can select players by usernames and add a specific color for each player. Add booleansetting (toggle) and color setting for "Generic", "Friends", "Specific (here the special color setting per username)". Generic is any player (Not friend or specific). Friends is all players in friend list (that are not in "Specific"). PlayerESP should then glow the hitboxes of the selected players in the right color.
